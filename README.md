# Shotify
An image repository app prepared by Moe Amadou for the Fall 2021 Shopify Backend Developer Intern Challenge.

## Getting Started
To use Shotify, you will have to create an account or log in using one of the sandbox accounts below:

#### Account 1 Creds
username: moe
password: 123456

#### Account 2 Creds
username: paul
password: Mynameispaul1

After logging in, you will be taken to a page that lists all of the images currently stored in the repository as well as a form to add an image.

### Adding Images
To add an image, you will need to specify a *slug*(a brief, underscore-separated description such as this_is_a_slug) as well as permissions(public or private), and upload an image file. This is done through the homepage once you have been logged in.

### Viewing Images
To view an image's details, including its owner and publishing date, click on its slug from the homepage.

### Deleting Images
To delete an image, click on the image slug from the homepage and then select the delete button below the image. *Note*: You may only delete an image if you are logged in as the owner of said image.
